## Project Description

Controlling mobile manipulators like the Stretch robot typically involves keyboard or joystick-based teleoperation, which can be unintuitive or inefficient in real-world human-robot interaction. Our project proposes a gesture-based control interface that allows users to intuitively command both the mobile base and the manipulator arm of the Stretch robot using hand gestures. These gestures will be interpreted from a video feed and translated into control commands for movement and object manipulation within the Gazebo simulation environment. The goal is to enable more natural, user-friendly robot control.
